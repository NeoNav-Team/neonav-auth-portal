<Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>This End-User License Agreement (EULA) is a legal agreement between you (either as an individual or on behalf of an entity) and Wayward Communication Corporation (the creators of this software) regarding your use of NeoNav applications, and associated documentation (the &quot;Software&quot;).

Malicious use of that freedom will result in removal from the platform. You also take full responsibility for any and all content you post on this platform, as it functions as an open and public forum.</Typography>
